## 🔬 Core System Architecture Overview

Sanjeevani's architecture follows a highly decoupled, state-driven functional reactive paradigm. The application acts as a sovereign clinical edge node, processing high-bandwidth sensory data (Video, Audio, Vital Signs) on the client side using WebGL and WebAudio, and transmitting structured semantic tensors to our Swarm AI backend.

## 🚀 Key Technological Modules & Features in Extreme Detail

### 1. 👁️ The Duchenne Multimodal Pain Engine
An incredibly sophisticated subsystem that combines raw facial micro-expression analysis with acoustic frequency distress mapping. This engine eliminates the false-positive bias of traditional systems that cannot differentiate between a laugh and a scream.

#### Feature Highlights:
- **Corrugator Muscle Matrix Tracking:** Precisely measures the Euclidean distance between inner eyebrow keypoints (Points 107 & 336) to detect localized pain-induced furrowing.
- **Duchenne vs. Non-Duchenne Smile Discrimination:** Distinguishes between a genuine happy smile, a grimace, and a screaming jaw drop by comparing mouth corner elevation to the central top lip Y-axis plane, virtually eliminating false-positive "happy" readings during agony.
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Audio Processing:** Listens to microphone audio to isolate high-frequency vocal spikes (screaming, wailing, crying).
- **Synergistic Max-Pooling Algorithmic Engine:** Uses `Math.max(facialScore, vocalScore)` ensuring that severe physical pain in total silence is registered as Critical Agony, bypassing traditional audio-reliant bias.

### 2. 🎨 Raw & Uncensored Psychological Art Therapy Engine
Sanjeevani AI does not hide behind sterile safety filters. It embraces the dark, chaotic, and raw psychological reality of trauma patients through expressive art interpretation.
- **Unfiltered Prompt Bypass System:** Hardcoded system messages force the AI to objectively psychoanalyze explicit, disturbing, or highly sensual art inputs without triggering generic corporate safety rejections.
- **Color Psychology Mapping:** Dynamically generates Hex code palettes mirroring the patient's internal psychological state based on Jungian archetypes.
- **Therapeutic Catharsis Protocol:** Provides deep, unjudging clinical insights into trauma, mania, and depression.

```

### 3. ⚖️ Multi-Agent Diagnostic Debate Council
Instead of relying on one single AI model, Sanjeevani summons an entire virtual medical board. It utilizes a multi-step inference chain to prevent hallucinations.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Automatically recruits 4 to 6 relevant specialists (e.g., Dr. Heart, Dr. Tox, Dr. Mind) based on the specific symptom input.
- **Cross-Examination:** Simulates an aggressive, highly technical debate where AI doctors challenge each other's differential diagnoses and highlight contraindications.
- **Consensus Protocol:** Reaches a scientifically rigorous consensus before generating final treatment plans.

    }
    
    DebateArena --> ConsensusGeneration
    ConsensusGeneration --> FinalDiagnosis
    FinalDiagnosis --> [*]
```

### 4. 🧬 Pharmacovigilance & Genomic Scanner
A hyper-vigilant subsystem dedicated to preventing adverse drug reactions and predicting genetic liabilities.
- **Hyper-realistic Drug Interaction Scanning:** Utilizing simulated clinical pharmacology datasets, the Pharma AI flags life-threatening contraindications (e.g., Serotonin Syndrome, QT Prolongation, Synergistic CNS Depression).
- **Allergy Cross-Referencing:** Instantly cross-checks new prescriptions against the patient's past medical history to prevent anaphylaxis.
- **CRISPR Genomic Simulation:** Analyzes raw DNA sequences (Chr:Pos format) to simulate detection of pathogenic variants (BRCA1, CFTR) and outputs simulated CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA target sequences for precision editing.

### 5. 🌍 Epidemic Radar & Global Outbreak Tracker
A macro-level AI surveillance tool designed to scrape the internet, global news, and simulated WHO/CDC feeds to detect emerging biological threats.
- **Real-Time Web Scraping API:** Fetches the latest global news regarding viral outbreaks, unknown diseases, and high-transmission pathogens.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Categorizes outbreaks by continent and severity, generating localized heatmaps and transmission trajectories.
- **Clinical Protocol Generation:** Automatically synthesizes standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the ER to handle the specific incoming pathogen.

```

### 6. 🫀 Touchless Vitals Extractor (rPPG & Computer Vision)
Sanjeevani AI goes beyond questions and answers; it physically examines the patient through the lens.
- **Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG):** Analyzes micro-fluctuations in skin color across the forehead and cheeks, caused by blood flow, to estimate Heart Rate (BPM).
- **Respiration Tracking:** Measures the periodic expansion and contraction of the chest cavity through computer vision to calculate Respiratory Rate (Breaths per Minute).
- **Clinical Grade Output:** Visualizes the extracted data on a live, sweeping ECG-style graph in the browser UI, mimicking a real ICU monitor.

## 🔐 Security & Data Privacy
- **Zero-Storage Edge Compute:** All video streams, audio frequency analysis, and rPPG vitals extraction are executed 100% locally on the user's browser via WebAssembly. **No raw video, photos, or audio is ever uploaded to a server.** Only structured semantic JSON data is sent to the LLM.
- **Secret Scanning Compliant:** The entire Git commit history has been systematically purged and verified against GitHub Advanced Security to ensure zero leaked secrets. API keys are safely managed via Vite Environment variables.
- **HIPAA-Ready Architecture Design:** By processing sensitive biometric data strictly on the client edge node, Sanjeevani drastically reduces the attack surface for patient data breaches.

> "Sanjeevani AI does not just mimic healthcare; it fundamentally re-engineers the triage and diagnostic pipeline using sovereign edge intelligence."
